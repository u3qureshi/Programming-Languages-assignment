# Programming-Languages-assignment

Assignment instructions:

Given the grammar for a hypothetical imperative programming language, write a program that analyzes the syntax of input programs for the language. Your program should read an input test program from a file and then determine whether or not it contains any syntax errors. The program does not have to show where the syntax error occurred or what kind of error it was. You can use any programming language you prefer to write the program.

In your program:

    1) Implement a lexical analyzer as a subprogram of your program. Each time the lexical analyzer is called, it should return the next lexeme and its token code.
    2) Implement a parser based on the following EBNF rules. Create a subprogram for each nonterminal symbol which should parse only sentences that can be generated by the nonterminal.
    
          <program> -> program begin <statement_list> end
          <statement_list> -> <statement> {;<statement>}
          <statement> -> <assignment_statement> | <if_statement> | <loop_statement>
          <assignment_statement> -> <variable> = <expression>
          <variable> -> identifier (An identifier is a string that begins with a letter followed by 0 or more letters and/or digits)
          <expression> -> <term> { (+|-) <term>}
          <term> -> <factor> {(* | /) <factor> }
          <factor> -> identifier | int_constant | (<expr>)
          <if_statement> -> if (<logic_expression>) then <statement>
          <logic_expression> -> <variable> (< | >) <variable> (Assume that logic expressions have only less than or greater than operators)
          <loop_statement> -> loop (<logic_expression>) <statement>
